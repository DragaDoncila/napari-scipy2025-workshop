# **TITLE TBD**

This is a three-part workshop that will guide you through the different ways of using napari, from the basics of viewing images and the interface, to extending
the interface with your own GUI elements and event handlers, to distributing your new analysis workflows via plugins.

## Getting Started

The first step is installing `napari`. We will be using `napari` from Python via Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts.

To install `napari`, follow the [installation guide](./installation.md). Once you've launched a napari viewer, you're ready to start!
